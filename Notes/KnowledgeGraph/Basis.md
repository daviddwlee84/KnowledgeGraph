# Knowledge Graph Basis

## Background

* **Semantic Web**
  * Fusion innovation of traditional artificial intelligence and Web
  * Application of knowledge representation and inference in Web

## Knowledge Graph

> Knowledge Graph = Computational Model of Relations

Definition: Knowledge graph is a technical approach that use **graph model/structure** to *represent knowledge* and *modeling the relation between everything*.

* Node
  * Entity
    * e.g. a person, a book
  * Abstract concept
    * e.g. AI, knowledge graph
* Edge
  * Property
    * e.g. person name, book name
  * Relation
    * e.g. friend, couple

## Practice

* Google Knowledge Graph: Freebase
* IBM Waston: DBpedia, Yago
* Amazon Alexa: True Knowledge
* Apple Siri: Wolfram Alpha
* Open Source
  * Semantic Web Schema: Schema.ORG
  * Wikidata
